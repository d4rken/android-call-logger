# android-call-logger

A small app that just logs called numbers, even without reception :wink: , inspired by this fellas predicament:

> I met a cute girl in the subway and I got her number and I immediately called her but then realized I had no reception and closed the call. I thought the number would be stored for later as an outgoing call but now it's nowhere to be found. Is there any way to find it? If you know this please help!!
